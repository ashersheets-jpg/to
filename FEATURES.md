# Crimson Desert Seamless Co-op+ (alpha): features

Two-player co-op for Crimson Desert (Steam, game version 1.0.0.3576). Each of you plays in your own save;
your friend joins your world as their own character. Unofficial fan mod, built on Crimson Desert Multiplayer by
ByJunter and its port by nouzert1.

**How to read the Status column**
- **Works:** checked in the game on one PC against a stand-in second player. It should work, but a report from two
  real players still helps.
- **Needs testing:** built, but one PC can't show it. It needs two real players to confirm.
- **Not yet:** not possible in this version.

| A cutscene you both watch skips when you both press Skip | Needs testing |
| The host's boss and story cutscenes shown in the guest's game | Off for now: it could skip the guest's own story cutscene (the end of the prologue). [coop] stage_cinema=1 turns it on |

**Known issues:** two players only. Co-op saves and live quests are new and experimental (opt in; first two-player session done, fixes from it are in). In co-op you stay on your feet behind the death screen until you revive. The arm wrestling table can be empty for a guest who
arrives already connected; leave the pub and come back. Don't save while your friend is in your world (backups
are made for you).
