# Crimson Desert Seamless Co-op+ (playtest)

An unofficial fan mod that adds two-player co-op to **Crimson Desert** (Steam). Each player keeps their own save;
your friend joins your world as their own character. It is built on Crimson Desert Multiplayer by ByJunter and its
port by nouzert1. GPL-3.0, and the source of each build is inside its zip (`source.zip`).

**Alpha playtest.** Expect bugs. The installer backs up your saves. Don't save while your friend is in your world.

## Download
Get the newest build from **[Releases > Latest](../../releases/latest)**. Download the file named
`CrimsonDesert-SeamlessCoop-<version>.zip` (not the `-mod-manager` one, unless you use a mod manager).

**Both players need the same zip.**

## Requirements
- Crimson Desert on Steam, game version **1.0.0.3576**. On another version the mod switches itself off.
- You and your friend are Steam friends, with the Steam overlay on.

## Install
1. Close the game.
2. Right-click the downloaded zip > **Properties**. If there's an **Unblock** box at the bottom, tick it and press
   OK. Windows marks downloaded files, and this stops the "Windows protected your PC" prompt.
3. Right-click the zip > **Extract All...** and extract it anywhere, for example the Desktop.
4. In the extracted folder, double-click **`Install Co-op+.cmd`**. It finds the game through Steam, backs up your
   saves to `Documents\CrimsonDesert-CoopPlus-SaveBackups`, and copies 4 files into the game's `bin64` folder.
   - If Windows SmartScreen still appears: **More info > Run anyway**. The scripts are plain text, so you can open
     them in Notepad first.
5. Start Crimson Desert from Steam: the Co-op menu appears in place of the title screen. A controls card appears the first time. **Shift+F1** (or hold
   View / Touchpad and click the left stick) opens it again any time.

## Play together
- **NEW: the Co-op menu** stands in for the title screen. **Host:** pick **Invite Friends** and choose your friend
  in the Steam overlay (in the world: **Ctrl+F1**, pad: hold View + Y).
- **Friend:** accept the invite, or right-click the host in your Steam friends list > **Join Game**. Stay at the
  Co-op menu; both menus list the party (the crown marks the host).
- **Host:** pick **Start Co-op**, then Continue Our Co-op Save, Start From My Solo Progress or New Co-op Save. A new
  game begins with the prologue, which each of you plays on your own; co-op starts by itself after it.
- **Experience is shared:** every skill point either of you earns goes to the other too.
- **No Steam invite (Radmin VPN, LAN)?** Both join the same Radmin network. Host: Co-op menu > **Radmin VPN / Direct IP** >
  **Host** (an invite is copied; paste it to your friend). Friend: copy the invite, then **Radmin VPN / Direct IP** > **Join**.
- **F8** (pad: View + X) opens the co-op panel: connection, settings, your record.
- **Your saves are never changed by Co-op+.**
- **Experimental (you choose):** a co-op save of its own for each friend you play with, and quest steps shared
  live. **The first time you play together you both begin a new journey** at the start of the story. The first
  launch asks: **Shift+F5** (pad: View + D-pad Up) turns it on, **Shift+F6** is "not now"; change it any time in
  F8 > Settings. Both players need it on. Switching between your own save and a co-op save always asks first.

## Uninstall / turn off
- `Uninstall Co-op+.cmd` removes exactly what was installed.
- `Vanilla mode on-off.cmd` switches the mod off and back on, keeping your settings.

## Report a bug
Double-click `Diagnose Co-op+.cmd` (game closed). It puts a zip on your clipboard with your Steam names, IDs and
Windows user name removed. Paste it in the Discord bug channel with what happened (`BUG-REPORT.txt` has the
questions). Reports from **both** players are best.

## What's in it
See [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md). Features marked **Needs testing** are the ones that most need your reports.
